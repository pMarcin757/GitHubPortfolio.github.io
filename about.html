      Hello, my name is Philip Marcinkowski. I am attending MIT for the
      Professional Certificate in Coding for a Full Stack Development with MERN.
      I have always been interested in coding and with my current job, it has
      become big part of my role. In my current role, I mainly code in VBA, but
      I am looking to expand my knowledge of different coding languages and
      continue to improve on my skills. Before I started coding, I was a
      motorcycle technician and I am currently a mechanical engineer. As coding
      becomes more beneficial across all fields, I knew it was important to
      improve on what I currently know. I am very excited for this course and to
      improve my current skills and bring this into my everyday life.
    </p>

    <h2>Bio</h2>
    <p>
      For over 10 years, being a mechanical suspension engineer has been my
      passion. Over the years this passion for designing mechanical things has
      turned into a passion for developing coding applications. Using my
      knowledge of design and problem solving will help me become a better
      developer. Through current and previous jobs, I was able to gain
      experience coding websites, developing applications, and learning a few
      different coding languages. This entry level of knowledge has brought me
      to MIT for their Full Stack Developer course. I am excited to build off
      what I have learned and bring my engineering skills to develop new things.
